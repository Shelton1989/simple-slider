# simple-slider
This slider uses JavaScript to manipulate the css attributes of each slide.

Essentially, the JavaScript code at the bottom of the html document changes the opacity attribute of each slide when either there is a click event or when the DOM loads. In the latter case, the setInterval function executes a function every 10 seconds.
